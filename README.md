This repository contains a web-based system for submitting and reviewing requests. Users can post requests that are stored in a MySQL database via phpMyAdmin. Advisors review these requests, providing advice or denial with an explanation. Built with HTML, CSS, and PHP, the project ensures smooth communication between users and advisors.
